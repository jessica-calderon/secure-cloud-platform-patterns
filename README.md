- Image scanning and vulnerability remediation
- Secure runtime configurations

## DevSecOps and Pipeline Security
- CI/CD security controls
- Artifact integrity
- Secrets management

## Logging, Monitoring, and Incident Response
- Centralized logging
- Audit trails
- Detection and response workflows

## Compliance, Governance, and RMF Considerations
- Continuous monitoring
- Control validation
- Documentation and evidence collection
